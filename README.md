# Face Emotion Detector Using ResNet50

This project utilizes the ResNet50 architecture to detect emotions from facial expressions. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled facial images with corresponding emotions.

## Overview

The Face Emotion Detector uses deep learning techniques to recognize facial expressions from images. It detects various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc. The ResNet50 model is employed as it offers high accuracy in image classification tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IshaDhumal/Face-Emotion-Detector-Using-ResNet50.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Face-Emotion-Detector-Using-ResNet50
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. The application will launch, allowing you to upload an image containing a face.

3. After uploading the image, the model will detect the facial expression and display the predicted emotion along with a confidence score.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train the model is not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. However, any suitable facial expression dataset can be used for training.

## Model
